## CMOS Switching Threshold & Dynamic Simulations

---

## üìò 1. Introduction / Background

This session focuses on analyzing the switching threshold of the CMOS inverter and exploring its static and dynamic performance through SPICE simulations.

**Why it matters:**

* The switching threshold voltage (VM) is a key parameter that determines noise margins and logic robustness.
* By adjusting PMOS and NMOS sizing ratios, we can tune VM to improve inverter symmetry and noise immunity.
* Dynamic simulations help observe real switching behavior, including rise/fall delay and transition slopes, which directly influence timing in real digital circuits.

##  2. Theory & Key Concepts

### 2.1 Switching Threshold (VM)

* VM is the input voltage at which the inverter output equals the input.
* At VM, both NMOS and PMOS are in saturation.
* VM ‚âà VDD/2 gives maximum noise margin.
* PMOS is usually sized larger than NMOS to compensate for lower mobility.

### 2.2 Relation Between VM and Sizing Ratio

* The ratio of PMOS to NMOS sizing (Wp/Lp vs Wn/Ln) determines VM.
* Typically, the ratio is chosen around 2‚Äì3 to balance the inverter.

### 2.3 Dynamic Behavior of CMOS Inverter

* Output transitions are determined by charging/discharging of the load capacitance.
* tPLH ‚Äî propagation delay for LOW‚ÜíHIGH transition
* tPHL ‚Äî propagation delay for HIGH‚ÜíLOW transition
* Average propagation delay tp = (tPLH + tPHL)/2
* PMOS and NMOS sizing strongly affect rise/fall asymmetry. Larger PMOS width improves charging, leading to more balanced delay.
